# **Welcome Cryptonauts - Are you ready to build the future?**


The *purpose* of this document is to help you find your place within the collective.

We are always open for new contributors and welcome new ideas. No idea is too stupid to be discussed. We can all laugh about it at the very least. :smiley: 

Everyone has a different journey within the collective and you can choose how you spend your time here. 

Start by filling out [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1izilMBRoE3krtTPmHR9Tbw1ScvX6gSYBFltCGp7gv6A/edit) so we can bring relevant opportunities to your doorstep.

If you are a developer and would like to start contributing some code, we have some well defined steps for you to take.

# Developer Onboarding :computer: 

### Firstly, go through [Ethereum dev speed run](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8Fethereum-dev-speed-run-bd72bcba6a4c). 
This article has tutorials, challenges and walkthroughs for building dapps with ethereum and react using [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth). This speed run is absolutely sick!

Scaffold-eth is a great place to make your first contribution. Leave feedback on their [telegram channel](https://t.me/joinchat/KByvmRe5wkR-8F_zz6AjpA), raise an issue or submit a pull request on their [github repo](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth). :cake: 
&nbsp;  

### Secondly, start lurking like a gherkin. :cucumber:  

Join telegram discussions and our [daily calls](#call-schedule). It's ok to lurk on these calls and just bring vibes. :call_me_hand:   It's also ok to bring ideas if you feel comfortable!

This will let you meet current MC members and expose you to current projects being built.

A good way to start contributing to existing projects is testing out builds, writing documentation and doing code reviews. Most projects have telegram specific channels so you can ask existing members to join them and get a bit closer to the action.


At this stage, you should be ready to begin contributing code to existing projects or even setting up one of your own! :rainbow: 

 # Designer Onboarding :artist: 

### Code curious designers can look through [Ethereum dev speed run](https://medium.com/@austin_48503/%EF%B8%8Fethereum-dev-speed-run-bd72bcba6a4c).

### Start lurking like a sea-urchin :fish:
Join telegram discussions and our daily calls. Here, you can see how projects look and offer your help if you find some poor developers in need of some design guidance.

 # Other Onboarding :artist: 

We don't have systematic onboarding steps for other roles at the minute but we would still love your input. Our collective will be more innovative if we have a diverse group of people so please get involved on telegram and the daily calls and we will find a place for you.

# Setting up your own project in Moonshot Collective :rocket:


Do you have a cool idea that you'd like to set up?

Discuss it on one of the daily calls or bring it up in telegram. Alternatively, put it on this Notion doc which will allow you to put some more information and allow others to ask questions and comment on your idea.

If you can't find anyone to work on your project, you can start it off on your own and your courage may attract some other moonshots :moon: :rocket:


# Call Schedule



We have different calls for different purposes

**Daily office hours with Ryan**

**Dogfooding session every Friday**

**Daily troubleshooting**
